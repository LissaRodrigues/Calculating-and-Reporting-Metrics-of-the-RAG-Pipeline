Healthcare Guide Chatbot with RAG and Vector Database
Overview
This project presents a domain-specific chatbot designed to offer personalized healthcare advice by leveraging the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLM) in conjunction with the efficiency of a vector database for data storage and retrieval. By employing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), the chatbot provides tailored healthcare recommendations based solely on user inputs. The application is built using Flowise and integrates multiple components to ensure accurate and relevant responses to users' healthcare-related queries.
